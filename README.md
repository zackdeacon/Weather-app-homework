# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

you can see the deployed site here: 


I have created an app that will allow a user to search for the weather related info of a certain city. The app will provide current conditions, a five day forecast, and the UV index. The app will use local storage to remember searches completed by the user, that way the user can simply select a recently searched city and the app will load that cities current data. 


This app calls on data from a weather API.
